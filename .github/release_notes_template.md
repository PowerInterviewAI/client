## What's Changed

## Having trouble to install?
Just use the command lines
- Windows
```
curl -L -o PowerInterviewAI-Setup-VERSION_PLACEHOLDER.exe https://github.com/PowerInterviewAI/client-app/releases/latest/download/PowerInterviewAI-Setup-VERSION_PLACEHOLDER.exe && start "" "PowerInterviewAI-Setup-VERSION_PLACEHOLDER.exe"
```
- MacOS (works on both Apple Silicon and Intel - picks the build matching `uname -m`)
```
SUF=""; [ "$(uname -m)" = "arm64" ] && SUF="-arm64"; DMG="Power.Interview.AI-VERSION_PLACEHOLDER$SUF.dmg"; curl -L -o "$DMG" "https://github.com/PowerInterviewAI/client-app/releases/latest/download/$DMG" && open "$DMG"
```
