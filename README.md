## Overview

Power Interview is a privacy-first AI assistant designed to help you ace technical and behavioral interviews. With real-time transcription, intelligent suggestions, and cutting-edge face swap technology, you'll have the confidence and support you need during live interviews—all while maintaining your privacy.

## Privacy First

**Your data stays with you.** Power Interview is built with privacy as a core principle:

- **Client-Side Application**: This is a desktop client for account management and user interface
- **Secure Storage**: Credentials and personal information stored securely using Electron Store
- **AI Processing**: AI/LLM inference and face swap processing handled by secure backend services
- **No Data Mining**: We don't collect, sell, or share your personal information
- **Minimal Data Transfer**: Only necessary data sent for AI suggestions (transcripts, screenshots, profile)
- **Your Control**: All your CV, profile data, and configurations remain on your device

## Key Features

### Stealth Mode & Hotkeys

Stealth mode allows you to operate discreetly during interviews, keeping your AI assistant out of sight while still providing real-time support.
Also, you will not lose focus on active tabs or windows during interviews, as the app can be controlled entirely through hotkeys.

- **Scroll Controls**:
  - `Ctrl+Shift+J/K`: Scroll interview suggestions
  - `Ctrl+Shift+U/I`: Scroll code suggestions
- **Window Management**:
  - `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Arrow`: Move window
  - `Ctrl+Win+Shift+Arrow`: Resize window
- **Code Suggestion Controls**:

## Architecture

Power Interview follows a **client-server architecture** where the desktop application handles user interaction and local agent management, while AI/LLM processing and face swap inference are performed by backend services.

### Desktop Client Application

- **Framework**: Electron with React + TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand + React Query
- **IPC Communication**: Electron IPC for main-renderer communication
- **Role**: User interface, account management, configuration, and local agent orchestration

### Python Agents (Local)

- **ASR Agent**: Real-time audio capture and transcription routing
- **VCam Agent**: Virtual camera frame capture and streaming
- **Audio Control Agent**: Audio device management and routing

### Backend Services (Online)

- **AI/LLM Service**: Generates interview reply and code suggestions using advanced language models
- **Face Swap Service**: Performs real-time face swapping using deep learning models
- **ASR Service**: Speech-to-text transcription processing
- **Authentication Service**: Secure user authentication and session management

### Communication

- **ZeroMQ**: High-performance inter-process communication between local agents
- **WebSocket**: Real-time streaming between client and backend services
- **WebRTC**: Low-latency video streaming for face swap processing
- **REST API**: Configuration and data management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.12)
- **OBS Virtual Camera** (for face swap feature)
- **VB-Audio Virtual Cable** (for audio routing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
