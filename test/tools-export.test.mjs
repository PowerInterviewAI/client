/**
 * Export is assembled as Markdown and only then converted, so the same string is what a .md
 * export writes verbatim and what the .docx converter is fed. These pin that assembly and the
 * filename extension, which is what decides the format the save dialog offers.
 *
 * Only the pure helpers are covered - exportTranscript() itself needs `dialog` and the LLM API,
 * neither of which the electron stub provides.
