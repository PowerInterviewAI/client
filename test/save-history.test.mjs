/**
 * Everything that destroys the interview asks to save it first, and the question is only worth
 * asking about a real one. The panels are seeded with placeholder copy on launch and again
 * after every Clear, so `transcripts.length` is never zero and cannot be the test.
 *
 * `hasHistory` is what the prompt and the export guard both read. These pin that it follows the
 * writes rather than the array lengths, and that an export refuses the placeholder - which the
 * length check let through, producing a billed summary of "Transcripts will be here".
