/**
 * The macOS Dock icon is the counterpart of the Windows taskbar button: present in normal mode,
 * gone in stealth. It has a failure mode the taskbar button does not - macOS drops a Dock call
 * made within a second of the previous one, silently, so toggling stealth a few times in quick
 * succession could leave the icon sitting on screen during a shared call with nothing logged.
 *
 * These branches read `process.platform` at module scope, so they are dead code on the Linux
 * runner CI uses. `loadMainAs('darwin', ...)` loads a second instance that believes it is on
 * macOS, and the electron stub records every Dock and activation-policy call in order.
